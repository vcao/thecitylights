			<h1>About</h1>
				<p>The City Lights is the collaborative work of few local youth ministers, Catholic musicians and artists, who seek to respond to the call of the New Evangelization. We are in submission to the Bishop of Orange, Kevin Vann, and are supported by the Diocese of Orange in our efforts.</p>
		
				<p>Blessed Pope John Paul II said, “The Gospel lives in conversation with culture, and if the Church holds back from the culture, the Gospel itself falls silent.” With that in mind, we must ask ourselves not if, but how, has the Church held back from engaging the culture?</p>
		
				<h2>The Numbers</h2>
				<p>There are about 3.1 million people living in sunny Orange County. Out of that 3.1 million there are approximately 1.3 million Catholics, and that doesn’t include our fallen away brothers and sisters who have left the Church. In a recent census, it’s been reported that around 400,000 of those 1.3 million Catholics attend Mass regularly. That means that more than two-thirds of the Catholics in our Diocese are not coming to the altar to receive the Bread of Life. Furthermore, those numbers speak nothing to the level of engagement for those 400,000 that do find themselves in the pews on a regular basis. How many hearts and minds are present, not just obligatory bodies?</p>
		
				<h2>The Issue</h2>
				<p>It’s not their fault, at least not entirely. A great deal of culpability falls on those of us who work within the Church, those of us who have been entrusted with the beauty of the Gospel and have possibly fallen short in engaging the culture with that life-changing beauty. We at City Lights believe that if someone truly knew what was going on at Mass it would be impossible to keep them from it. Imagine if we truly grasped the miraculous magnitude of the presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the Eucharist at Mass. There is nothing in life that's bigger, more important, more life altering, and more real than the fact that we as sinful human beings are allowed to hold the God of the Universe in our feeble little hands, even more so, receive Him into us. We consume God. God consumes us. We can be in intimate communion with the Creator of the stars. If our hearts understood that, then, like many saints that have come before us, we would gladly die than face the thought of missing that moment.</p>
		
				<p>If we were handing out stacks of cash at Mass, the only people who would not be in the communion line would be those who never knew it was happening in the first place. However, we don’t give out money, we give out a Treasure that is far more valuable than all the riches of the world. Yet, we only have one-third of our family lining up to receive the Good News that is the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus Christ, fully present at Mass.</p>
		
				<p>Mass is the goal. But if they’re not at Mass, what do we do? How do we bridge them to the intimacy of Christ’s presence in the Mass? In regards to this, Blessed John Paul 2 referred to the need for mankind to have an “encounter with the Living Jesus Christ.” This encounter would lead to conversion and a deeper relationship with our Lord, culminating in our union with Him at Mass.</p>
		
				<p>The goal of City Lights is to set the stage for that encounter. Through culturally relevant, yet authentically Catholic means, our aim is to host beautifully and intentionally crafted events throughout Orange County, outside of the Church building, in order to point back to the Church body. At the Incarnation, Christ left Heaven and entered the relevance of the human condition. He came to us, so that we might come to Him. In a similar way, we hope to engage the culture where it is found: In music, in inspiration, in beauty, and in the common venues among the city streets.</p>

				<h2>The Action</h2>
				<p>Our first attempt will be at the historic Yost Theater in downtown Santa Ana. This 100 year old building plays host to a variety of events ranging from concerts, to raves, and even burlesque shows, will now host the the King of Kings, the Eucharistic Host. On February 11th, 2014, The City Lights will be opening The Yost’s doors for “God Among Us”, a night of inspirational message, heart moving worship, and above all adoration of our Lord. It’s easy for us to see these worldly venues and run from them, but instead we must  follow Christ’s example and run to them, not to be swayed by them, but to redeem them, to glorify God with them, to use them as beacons where the culture can interact with the Gospel.</p>
		
				<p>We can’t do this alone. We need your prayers, energy, and <a href="#donate">financial support</a>. All donations are processed through the Diocese of Orange and are tax deductible.
